## Introduction

Cancerware is a Win32 Keylogger built in C programming language. The keylogger not only
sets up a shell on host machine but logs all the keystrokes and is accessible by the reverse
shell on the machine.

### Stack

Target machine were machine running Windows that is why Win32 API was used.
I used C because C based binaries are small in size,  and I am crazy :) 

## Important Note:

I have also added notes and comments in my code in order to explain the working of the malware.

<strong> This Keylogger may only be used for educational purposes, the reason to built it was to dive deeper into malware analysis. </strong>
